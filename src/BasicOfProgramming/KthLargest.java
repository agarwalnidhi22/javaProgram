////    Problem 1: Given an integer array nums and an integer k, print the kth largest element in the array.
////    Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
////    You must solve it in O(n) time complexity.
////    Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
////    Output: 5
////    Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
////    Output: 4
